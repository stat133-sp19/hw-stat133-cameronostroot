> This is a wonderful and easy recipe to make for breakfast any time of the year!

##### *Ingredients*

-   2 large eggs
-   2 tablespoons milk, half-and-half or cream
-   1/8 teaspoon salt
-   Few grinds black pepper
-   2 teaspoons butter or olive oil
-   A 1-inch thick piece of bread
-   1 tablespoon goat cheese, softened a bit (though cream cheese is a great swap here)
-   1 teaspoon chives or scallion greens, thinly sliced

##### *Appliances Needed*

-   Glass bowl to wisk
-   Fork
-   Saute pan
-   Spatula
-   Toaster

##### *Lets Get Cooking*

1.  Beat eggs with milk, salt and pepper in a small bowl, with a fork, until combined, with a few big bubbles.
2.  Heat a large sauté pan over medium-low heat; once hot, add butter.
3.  Once butter is melted and foamy, add eggs and pause; count to 20 if you must, but let those eggs begin to set up before you start nudging away at them.
4.  Using a spatula, begin push your eggs once from the outside to the center of the pan and pause again; count to 5 if you must, before continuing with another push.
5.  Go around the pan as many times as needed, until your eggs in the center are ribbony damp pile — it should look only 75 percent cooked.
6.  Use your spatula to break up this pile into smaller chunks — to taste.
7.  Immediately remove the pan from the heat and pile the scrambled eggs bits high on your goat cheese toast.
8.  Sprinkle with an additional grind of black pepper and remaining chives.
9.  *Eat!*

> Of course you can get creative with your own recipe as you may not want to use goat cheese on your toast, or may want to add meat such as bacon. Get creative and have fun with this easy recipe!

**Euclidean Distance**
======================

### Definition

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\overline{\\textbf{pq}}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>,..., *p*<sub>n</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>,..., *q*<sub>n</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$   d(\\textbf{p},\\textbf{q}) = d(\\textbf{q},\\textbf{p}) =  \\sqrt{(q\_{1}-p\_{1})^2 + (q\_{2}-p\_{2})^2 + \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot + (q\_{n}-p\_{n})^2} $$

$$ =\\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n} (q\_{i}-p\_{i})^2} . $$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:\[1\]

$$ ||\\textbf{p}|| =  \\sqrt{p\_{1}^2 + p\_{2}^2 + \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot + p\_{n}^2} = \\sqrt{\\textbf{p} \\cdot \\textbf{p} }, $$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
