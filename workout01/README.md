# Workout01
Within this initial workout I will get more of an opportunity to work with complex file structure along with more practice working with GitHub in order to organize these files. 


I will also have to analyze the data of NBA players in 2016 and furthermore produce charts or "shot charts" for the Golden State Warriors, specifically looking at 5 players' data. 


Within my report I will also have to produce a cohesive document that analyzes the data that I will receive into a comprehensible narrative.
